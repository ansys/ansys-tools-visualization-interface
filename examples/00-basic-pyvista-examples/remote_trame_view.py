=============================
Use trame as a remote service
=============================

This example shows how to launch a trame service and use it as a remote service.
"""

"""
First, we need to launch the trame service. We can do this by running the following code:

```python
# import required libraries
from ansys.tools.visualization_interface.backends.pyvista.trame_service import (
    TrameService,
)

# create a trame service, in whatever port is available in your system
ts = TrameService(websocket_port=8765)

# run the service
ts.run()
```

Now, we can send meshes and plotter to the trame service. We can do this by running the following code in a separate terminal:

```python
# import required libraries
import time

import pyvista as pv

from ansys.tools.visualization_interface.backends.pyvista.trame_remote import (
    send_mesh,
    send_pl,
)

# create an example plotter
plotter = pv.Plotter()
plotter.add_mesh(pv.Cube())

# send some example meshes
send_mesh(pv.Sphere())
send_mesh(pv.Sphere(center=(3, 0, 0)))
time.sleep(4)

# if we send a plotter, the previous meshes will be deleted.
send_pl(plotter)
```
