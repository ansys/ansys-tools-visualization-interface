================================
Use the ``MeshObjectPlot`` class
================================

Visualization Interface tool provides the ``MeshObject`` helper class to relate a custom object
with its mesh. With a custom object, you can take advantage of the full potential of
Visualization Interface tool.

This example shows how to use the ``MeshObjectPlot`` class to plot your custom objects.
