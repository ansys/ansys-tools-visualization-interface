Visualization Interface Tool documentation |version|
====================================================

The Visualization Interface Tool is a Python API that provides an interface between PyAnsys libraries and
different plotting backends.

The Visualization Interface Tool offers these main features:

* Serves as an interface between PyAnsys and other plotting libraries (although only
  `PyVista <https://docs.pyvista.org/version/stable/>`_ is supported currently).
* Provides out-of-the box picking, viewing, and measuring functionalities.
* Supplies an extensible class for adding custom functionalities.
